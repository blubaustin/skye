Skye Distro Script thingy
Github won't let me upload large files for whatever reason, once mega is done will post a link to that. Thanks github.

Hardened latest kernel at time of typing this with all hardened options enabled in kernel, 03 optimization, debugging disabled. CIS Debian hardened level 1, librewolf, gimp, vlc, and some pdf reader, bluetooth disabled. Also there is a script on the desktop to install the nvidia drivers (proprietary), they cannot be included due to liscensing. Also the image is 40GB uncompressed due to this, because the ENTIRE linux kernel source that is also compiled is there. If it wasn't for this, it'd be allot smaller. So don't complain, thanks.

Use debian iso and install kde. Recommend dark theme but whatever floats your boat. As for stable diffusion if you need a script for that, I'll make one, cheers.

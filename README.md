Hardened latest kernel at time of typing this with all hardened options enabled in kernel, 03 optimization, debugging disabled. CIS Debian hardened level 1, librewolf, gimp, vlc, and some pdf reader, bluetooth disabled. Also there is a script on the desktop to install the nvidia drivers (proprietary), they cannot be included due to liscensing. Also the image is 40GB uncompressed due to this, because the ENTIRE linux kernel source that is also compiled is there. If it wasn't for this, it'd be allot smaller. So don't complain, thanks.

Going to make a script that will convert a default KDE debian 12 to this. Lets go.
